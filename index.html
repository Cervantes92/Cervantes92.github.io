		<h1>Welcome to Alexander's webpage</h1>
		<p>Here you will find a list and description of my personal projects as well as <br>
		links to what I have written for download.</p>

		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
		<h3>TileGame</h3>
		<p>Credit to CodeNMore for the tutorial series that guided me through making this <br>
		little application and learning how to write in java.</p>

		<h2>Future Projects</h2>
		<h3>TheCRPG</h3>
		<p>Taking inspiration from early tile-based rpgs such as the ultima series and the <br>
		dragon quest NES games, I intend to create a game engine that myself and others can <br>
		build their own tile-based open world adventures on.</p>

		<h3>Web apps with JavaScript</h3>
		<p>I plan to learn the syntax and nuances of JavaScript by making web apps links to <br>
		these web apps can be found below.</p>

		<h2>Completed Projects</h2>
